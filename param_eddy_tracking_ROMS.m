% param_eddy_tracking_ROMS.m
%
%   param_eddy_tracking sets user defined paths and parameters for a
%   degradation coefficient of 'deg' which goes from 1 (default)
%   to >10 in some experiment.
%
% Paths:
%   - path_in: directory containing the input files;
%              (default is '..\Data\')
%   - path_out: directory for the output files;
%              (default is '..\Tracks\')
%   - nc_u: full name of the netcdf file with the zonal component of
%           velocity (ssu) and the time index (day)
%   - nc_v: full name of the netcdf file with the meridional component of
%           velocity (ssv) and the time index (day)
%   - nc_dim: full name of the netcdf file with the domain coordinates 
%            (longitude and latitude) and the velocity mask (land-points=0;
%             ocean-points=1)
%
% User parameters definition:
%   - type_detection: flag to choose the field use as streamlines
%           1 : using velocity fields
%           2 : using ssh
%           3 : using both velocity fields and ssh for eddy contour, 
%               and keep the contour of the last one if it existS.
%   - extended_diags: flag to have extra diags concerning eddies directly
%       computed (like ellipse features or vorticity for each eddy)
%           0 : not computed
%           1 : computed as the same time as eddy detection
%           2 : computed afterward
%   - streamlines and daystreamfunction: save streamlines at steps 
%       'daystreamfunction' and profils of streamlines scanned as well
%   - periodic: flag to activate options for East-West periodic
%               (e.g. global fields or idealized simulations) domains.
%               IMPORTANT: first and last columns of the domain must be
%                          identical for this to work properly!!!!!
%
% Fixed parmeter:
%   - res: factor of interpolation of the fields (velocity and ssh)
%       to compute center detection. 2 or 3 seems reasonable in term of
%       computation time for 1/8Â° AVISO fields.
%   - K: LNAM(LOW<0) threshold to detect the potential eddy centers
%   - b: parameter for the computation of LNAM and Local Okubo-Weiss
%       (number of grid points in one of the 4 directions to define
%       the length of the box area used normalize Angular Momentum
%       and Okubo-Weiss fields)
%   - bx: number of grid points to define the initial area to scan
%       streamlines
%
%-------------------------
% IMPORTANT - Input file requirements:
%
% All the variables are read from netcdf file.
% The package requires 3 different input files:
% 1) nc_dim with variables x(j,i),y(j,i),mask(j,i)
% 2) nc_u with variable ssu(t,j,i), day(t)
% 3) nc_v with variable ssv(t,j,i), day(t)
%
% t is the temporal dimension (number of time steps)
% y is the zonal dimension (number of grid points along latitude)
% x is the meridional dimension (number of grid points along longitude)
%
% The grid is assumed to be rectangular, with orientation N-S and E-W. 
% Grid indices correspond to geography, so that point (1,1) represents the
%      south-western corner of the domain.
% Latitudinal and longitudinal grid spacing can vary within the grid domain.

% Resolution parameters:
%----------------------------------------------
% gama is resolution coefficient which is the number of pixels per Rd.
% After test gama>3 is required to get the max number of eddies.
gama = Rd / (Dx*deg); % around 1 for AVISO 1/8

% res is an integer and used to improve the precision of centers detection
% close to 3 pixels per Rd. res can goes up to 3
res = max(1,min(3,round(3/gama))); % [1 - 3]

% Detection parameters:
%----------------------------------------------
% K is LNAM(LOW<0) threshold to fixed contours where to detect potential center
% (one per contour). After test: no sensibility to K between 0.2 and 0.7
% but 0.7 give better time performance
K = 0.7; % [0 - 1]

% b is half length of the box in pixels used to normalise the LNAM and LOW.
% After test the optimal length of the box ( Lb = 2b*xd*deg )
% is fixed to one and half the size of Rd (Lb/Rd=1.2).
b = max(1,round((1.2*gama)/2));

% Rb (=Lb/Rd) is to check that the b setting and the gama are optimal.
% !!! Because optimal b is directly linked to gama, you start missing
% smaller eddies when gama is below 2 even at b=1
% (e.g. for AVISO 1/8 (gama~0.8) we have Rb~2.5) !!!
Rb = 2*b / gama;

% bx is half length of the box used in pixels to find contour streamlines
% in pixels bx = 10 times the Rd is enough to start testing any eddies
bx = max(1,round(10*gama));

% H is number of lines scanned in bx during detection of potential centers
% (centers0 to centers) and shapes (centers to centers2). After test 100
% seems a good compromise. This parameter is directly link to the time
% computation!
global H
H = 200; % number of line scanned
